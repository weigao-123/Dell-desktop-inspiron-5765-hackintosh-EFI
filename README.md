THis is for Dell desktop inspiron 5765 hackintosh, and I only tested MACOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65)

Hardware:
Motherboard: X370
CPU: Ryzen 5 1400
Graphic: RX570

Stuff which are working:
1. Ethernet works good.
2. Initially, I used the AppleALC.kext for the Audio, but it did not work. Finally, I tried the VoodooHDA.kext, and it can work, maybe not the best.
3. Graphic is driver-free, works well.
4. All Usbs are ok. 

Stuff which is not working:
1. Wifi and Bluetooth are not working, so for them, we need to buy another compatible wireless card, which can be searched online.
